                Space exploration is the use of astronomy and space technology to explore outer space.[1] While the exploration of space is currently carried out mainly by astronomers with telescopes, its physical 
                exploration is conducted both by uncrewed robotic space probes and human spaceflight. Space exploration, like its classical form astronomy, is one of the main sources for space science.
                While the observation of objects in space, known as astronomy, predates reliable recorded history, it was the development of large and relatively efficient rockets during the mid-twentieth century that allowed
                physical space exploration to become a reality. 
                Common rationales for exploring space include advancing scientific research, national prestige, uniting different nations, ensuring the future survival of humanity, and developing military and strategic advantages against other countries.

                The early era of space exploration was driven by a "Space Race" between the Soviet Union and the United States.
                 A driving force of the start of space exploration was during the Cold War. 
                 After the ability to create nuclear weapons, the narrative of defense/offense left land and the power to control the air became the focus.
                  Both the Soviet and the U.S. were fighting to prove their superiority in technology through exploring the unknown: space. In fact
                   the reason NASA was made was due to the response of Sputnik I.
